This course will provide an overview of the key ideas that underlie
the Bayesian approach to modeling data, with a particular focus on
text. The course will primarily consist of discussing, deriving, and
implementing a number of Bayesian models of text (and their associated
inference algorithms) in order to understand their fundamental
strengths and weaknesses, as well as explore the relationships between
them. The aim of the course is to develop the knowledge and skills
needed to design, implement, and apply such models to real-world
data. Students entering the course should have good programming
skills, knowledge of algorithms, knowledge of probability, statistics,
or machine learning, and a strong interest in text analysis. To
facilitate productive discussion, students with diverse research
backgrounds and interests are especially encouraged to participate.
